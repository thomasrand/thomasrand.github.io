                <p>IK Construction was awarded this project that entailed two iconic glass and steel cylinders. IKC developed detailed shop drawings that were consistent with design configurations. Our shop drawings included hundreds of welded and bolted unique connections. IKC fabricated all the structural steel members in our own fabrication shop facility. Fabricated structural members of the iconic glass & steel cylinders were then delivered to the job site, and subsequently erected on time and per budget by IKC.</p>
              
                <p>Erection for cylindrical Tube members were very difficult to erect due to the need for them to be in a cylindrical shape. During erection, when the sun beam shines on the the members, it takes a different shape. We had to have a full time Surveyor on site to keep shooting the elevation to direct us on the true plumbness. Many structural calculations were necessary to maintain the proper plumbness during erection.</p>
                <p>This very complex joint design was never previously associated with any structural design including that of ASIC. This was the first design of its class.  Intensive Engineering input was put forth to implement this design and translates this design into reality.  I.K. Construction was able to overcome every challenge to make this project a success.  This project was featured the best project for 2008 in the McGraw Hill Construction magazine</p>
